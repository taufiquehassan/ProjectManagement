## Notes on this chapter:

* **CBR** : Benefit-Cost Ratio, the bigger the number the better is the project
* **Business Document** is where the outline of the project is stated
* **An assumption og** is used to track all assumptions made throughout the project 
* The tool that is used for arranging a team with different skill set is a focus group, which is part of **Data Gathering**. “Meeting” and “interpersonal and team skills” do not involve a focus group.
* The **project management plan** contains the change management plan. 
Once a **change request** has been approved in the perform integrated change control process, the project manager will then execute the change in the **direct and manage project work process**
* Once a **Change  request** has been approved or rejected the project manager should update the *change log* to reflect the status of the change. 
* Once a deliverable has been accepted, the project manager should then conduct the **close project or phase** process. 
* **Explicit knowledge** is gained from words, pictures, and numbers, such as reading books. **Tacit** is generally from beliefs, insights, and experiences. 
* The first step in managing any issues on a project is to add it to the **issue log**. From there, the PM can get a **change request** to either change the vendor or add more time to the project. Once a change request has been approved, then the PM can update the **project management plan**.
* **The work performance data** will describe what is happening to the deliverable as it is being done.
* The **project charter** is used to authorize a project. 
* The **project management plan** and **stakeholder register** come after the charter is created. 
* The **business documents* are an input to create project charters.
* The **change management plan** is a part of the **project management plan** that will describes how to manage changes on a project. That includes getting them requested, assessed, approved, or rejected. 
* Once new knowledge has been acquired, the project manager should update the **lesson learned register**. 
* You should never stop work on a project without first understanding the impact of a change on a project. Never take action without first reviewing and assessing your information.
* The **final report** is an output of the close project or phase process that will document what happened on the project. 
* **Trend analysis** is used to analyze when a trend might be forming and where it’s going. **Variance analysis** is only used to find a variance, not to predict it.
